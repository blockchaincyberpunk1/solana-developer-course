Solana Smart Contract Auditing

Course: Solana Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to provide students with hands-on experience in auditing and securing smart contracts. By identifying vulnerabilities and proposing fixes in a vulnerable smart contract, students will learn essential skills for ensuring the security of blockchain applications on the Solana platform.

Instructions for Students:

Assignment Task:

Auditing and Securing a Solana Smart Contract

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to audit a Solana smart contract for security vulnerabilities. We will provide you with a smart contract code that contains vulnerabilities commonly found in blockchain applications. Your task is to perform a code audit, identify these vulnerabilities, and propose fixes to make the contract secure.

Assignment Requirements:

Code Audit (40 points):

We will provide you with a Solana smart contract code that contains security vulnerabilities.
Your task is to perform a thorough audit of the provided code to identify vulnerabilities. Common vulnerabilities may include reentrancy issues, input validation problems, or insecure state changes.
Document each vulnerability you find, including its nature, potential impact, and the lines of code where it exists.
Vulnerability Remediation (40 points):

After identifying vulnerabilities, propose and implement fixes to address each one.
Provide a clear explanation of the remediation steps you took for each vulnerability.
Ensure that your code modifications effectively mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
Report (20 points):

Submit a report summarizing your audit findings and remediation efforts.
Include a section detailing each identified vulnerability, the associated risks, and the fixes you implemented.
Provide explanations and reasoning for your proposed fixes.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit the audited smart contract code with your proposed fixes.
Submit the audit report outlining your findings and remediation steps.
Grading Rubric:

Code Audit (40 points)
Vulnerability Remediation (40 points)
Quality of Audit Report (20 points)
