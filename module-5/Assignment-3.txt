Unit Testing for Solana Smart Contracts

Course: Solana Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to familiarize students with writing unit tests for Solana smart contracts. By creating a suite of unit tests, students will learn how to ensure the functionality and correctness of their smart contracts.

Instructions for Students:

Assignment Task:

Creating Unit Tests for a Solana Smart Contract

In this assignment, you will be responsible for writing unit tests for a given Solana smart contract. The goal is to thoroughly test various functions within the contract, including edge cases and boundary conditions, to ensure that the contract behaves as expected.

Assignment Requirements:

Unit Test Suite (60 points):

You will be provided with a Solana smart contract.
Your task is to create a comprehensive suite of unit tests using a testing framework like solana-test or equivalent.
Write test cases that cover different aspects of the contract's functionality, including various function calls, inputs, and potential edge cases.
Ensure that you test the contract's behavior when invoked with valid inputs and when it encounters invalid inputs.
Test Report (20 points):

Execute your unit tests and record the test results.
Create a detailed test report that includes the following:
A summary of the tests conducted.
A description of each test case, including inputs and expected outcomes.
The actual outcomes of each test.
Any issues or failures encountered during testing.
Coverage Analysis (20 points):

Analyze the code coverage of your unit tests to ensure you have adequately tested the contract's functionality.
Identify any parts of the code that are not covered by your tests and explain why they might not be testable.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit the unit test code.
Submit the test report with detailed descriptions of the tests and their outcomes.
Include the coverage analysis report.
Grading Rubric:

Completeness and Quality of Unit Tests (60 points)
Quality of Test Report (20 points)
Coverage Analysis (20 points)
