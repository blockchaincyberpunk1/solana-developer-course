Solana Smart Contract Basics

Course: Solana Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to Solana smart contract development. Students will be tasked with creating a simple Solana smart contract using a template or example provided in the Solana documentation. The smart contract should perform a basic function, such as transferring tokens between accounts. Students will need to write the code, deploy the smart contract on a local network, and provide a brief explanation of how it works.
