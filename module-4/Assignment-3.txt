Solana dApp Performance Optimization

Course: Solana Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to optimize the performance of Solana decentralized applications (dApps). By analyzing a sample Solana dApp, students will learn strategies for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks to enhance the user experience.

Instructions for Students:

Assignment Task:

Solana dApp Performance Optimization

In this assignment, you will work on optimizing the performance of a Solana decentralized application (dApp). As a Solana developer, it's crucial to ensure that your dApps provide a smooth user experience with minimal latency.

Assignment Requirements:

Analyze the Sample Solana dApp (20 points):

You will be provided with a sample Solana dApp that performs various functions.
Carefully analyze the provided dApp code and identify areas where performance bottlenecks exist.
Optimize the dApp (40 points):

Propose and implement optimizations to reduce latency and enhance the user experience.
Possible optimizations may include:
Optimizing data retrieval from Solana's blockchain.
Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce redundant data fetching.
Parallelizing transactions to improve concurrency.
Identifying and addressing any inefficient loops or operations.
Documentation (30 points):

Create a document that explains the optimizations you made to the dApp.
Describe the specific changes you implemented and the reasoning behind each optimization.
Discuss how these optimizations impact the dApp's performance, including latency reduction and improved user experience.
Testing and Verification (10 points):

Test the optimized dApp to ensure that it functions correctly and exhibits improved performance.
Measure and compare the latency and responsiveness before and after optimizations.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit the optimized dApp code.
Submit the documentation in a format that is easily accessible and viewable.
Grading Rubric:
