Solana Smart Contract Development

Course: Solana Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to give students hands-on experience in creating and deploying Solana smart contracts using the Solana SDK. Students will follow a step-by-step guide to create a simple smart contract, such as a token contract or a basic decentralized application (dApp). They will then submit their code along with documentation explaining how the smart contract works.

Instructions for Students:

Assignment Task:

Solana Smart Contract Development

In this assignment, you will practice creating and deploying Solana smart contracts using the Solana SDK. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Solana's architecture and programming language, Rust, make it a powerful platform for developing smart contracts.

Assignment Requirements:

Smart Contract Development (70 points):

Follow the provided step-by-step guide or tutorial to create a simple Solana smart contract.
You can choose to create a token contract, a basic decentralized application (dApp), or any other simple contract of your choice.
Ensure that your code is well-structured and follows best practices for Solana smart contract development.
Documentation (20 points):

Provide clear and comprehensive documentation explaining how your smart contract works.
Describe the purpose of the contract, its key functions, and how it interacts with the Solana blockchain.
Include any important details about the contract's data structures and state management.
Testing and Deployment (10 points):

Test your smart contract to ensure it functions as intended.
Deploy your smart contract on a Solana testnet (e.g., Devnet) and provide the deployment details (e.g., contract address).
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your Solana smart contract code as a single Rust code file.
Include documentation in a separate text file or document (PDF, Markdown) along with your code.
Mention any external libraries or dependencies used in your project.
