Assignment Task:

Rust Programming Basics

In this assignment, you will be working on a series of coding exercises to strengthen your understanding of Rust programming fundamentals. These exercises cover a range of topics, including Rust syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and error handling.

Assignment Requirements:

Coding Exercises (70 points):

Complete the following coding exercises in Rust. Each exercise is worth a certain number of points based on its complexity.

Ensure your code is well-structured, follows Rust best practices, and is thoroughly commented to explain the logic.

Exercise 1 (10 points): Write a Rust program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

Exercise 2 (10 points): Create a Rust function that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum.

Exercise 3 (15 points): Write a Rust program that reads a user's input (integer) from the console and calculates its factorial.

Exercise 4 (15 points): Implement a Rust function that checks if a given number is prime.

Exercise 5 (20 points): Create a Rust program that reads a list of integers from the console, calculates their average, and displays it.

Error Handling (20 points):

Ensure that your code includes error handling mechanisms, such as checking for invalid user input or handling potential runtime errors gracefully.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your solutions as a single Rust code file.
Make sure your code is well-documented with comments to explain your logic.
Include a brief explanation of how you tested your code and any challenges you encountered during the exercises.
Grading Rubric:

Completion of Coding Exercises (70 points)
Error Handling (20 points)
Code Structure and Documentation (10 points)
