Front-End Development with React

Course: Solana Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to front-end development using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js is a valuable skill for creating the user interfaces of decentralized applications (dApps) on Solana.

Instructions for Students:

Assignment Task:

Front-End Development with React

In this assignment, you will dive into the world of front-end development using React.js. React is widely used for building user interfaces in web applications, including decentralized applications (dApps). By mastering React, you'll be well-equipped to create intuitive and responsive user interfaces for your Solana-based dApps.

Assignment Requirements:

React Basics (40 points):

Create a simple React-based web application unrelated to blockchain. It could be a to-do list, a weather app, or any other project of your choice.
Implement at least two React components with appropriate props and state.
Demonstrate your understanding of React's component lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate).
State Management (30 points):

Utilize React's state management to add dynamic behavior to your application. For example, you could create a component that allows users to add and remove items.
Show how your application's state changes based on user interactions.
Routing (20 points):

Implement client-side routing using React Router or a similar library.
Create multiple pages or views within your application, and ensure that users can navigate between them seamlessly.
Code Quality and Explanation (10 points):

Write clean and well-organized code following best practices for React development.
Include comments or explanations where necessary to clarify how your code works.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your React code along with any related files.
Include a brief explanation (in a document or as comments within your code) that provides an overview of your web application and explains how the different components and state management work.
