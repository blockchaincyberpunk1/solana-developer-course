Connecting Front-End to Solana

Course: Solana Developer Course

Assignment Objective: The objective of this assignment is to teach students how to interact with the Solana blockchain from a React-based front-end. Students will learn how to use Solana JavaScript libraries to connect their dApps to the Solana network, enabling them to retrieve and display blockchain data.

Instructions for Students:

Assignment Task:

Connecting Front-End to Solana

In this assignment, you will build on your React.js knowledge from the previous assignment to create a decentralized application (dApp) that interacts with the Solana blockchain. You will use Solana JavaScript libraries, such as Solana Web3.js, to connect your React-based front-end to the Solana blockchain network.

Assignment Requirements:

Solana Connection (40 points):

Follow the provided tutorial or guide on connecting a React-based front-end to the Solana blockchain using Solana JavaScript libraries.
Set up a connection to the Solana network, including specifying the network's endpoint.
Blockchain Data Retrieval (30 points):

Retrieve and display relevant information from the Solana blockchain. This could include fetching and displaying token balances, transaction history, or any other data of your choice.
Ensure that the data is displayed clearly and intuitively within your dApp's user interface.
User Interaction (20 points):

Implement user interactions that trigger actions on the Solana blockchain. For example, allow users to initiate transactions or perform other blockchain operations.
Ensure that these interactions are responsive and provide feedback to the user.
Code Quality and Documentation (10 points):

Write clean and well-documented code.
Include comments or explanations within your code to clarify how it interacts with the Solana blockchain.
Submission Guidelines:

Submit your React-based dApp code, including all necessary files.
Provide documentation or comments that explain how your dApp connects to the Solana blockchain and how users can interact with it.
Grading Rubric:

Solana Connection (40 points)
